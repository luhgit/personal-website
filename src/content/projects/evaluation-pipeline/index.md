**Context.** Clinicians rely on accurate AI-generated notes; hallucinations and omissions pose patient safety risks.

**Approach.** Designed an evaluation framework combining *reference-free* model judges, *reference-based* metrics, and compliance-oriented checks. Orchestrated evaluation pipelines with Azure tooling and reproducible scripts.

**Impact.** Enabled measurable quality & safety gates for healthcare deployments, reducing manual review overhead and increasing confidence in production readiness.
