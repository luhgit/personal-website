**Context.** Physicians spend significant time documenting patient visits. AI-driven clinical note generation can reduce this burden, but deployment in European markets requires linguistic, regulatory, and compliance adaptation.

**Approach.** Developed prompt-based note generation pipelines with specialty-specific postprocessing. Focused on multilingual adaptation (English ↔ German) and safe handling of PHI within secure environments.

**Impact.** Improved physician workflow efficiency while ensuring readiness for MDR and EU AI Act requirements, supporting scalable rollout across European healthcare systems.
